    <h4>Dynamically Adding Resources</h4>
    <p>Since resources on the cloud are not always available, users should have the ability to add resources as they become available.</p>
    <p>This project created the infrastructure to unobtrusively add resources.</p>
    <p>This registers the newly added resource with the master server and enables the master server to schedule tasks on it.</p>
    <hr class="skill_separator">
    <h4>Dynamically Removing Resources</h4>
    <p>There is a cost involved in using resources on the cloud. So users should be able to dynamically relinquish resources to lower cost of usage.</p>
    <p>To dynamically remove a resource while it is being used it is important to kill and reschedule any tasks running on it and also copy any files present on that resource to a different resource that is not being removed.</p>
    <p>The removed resource is deregistered from the server, so that no new tasks are scheduled on it.</p>
